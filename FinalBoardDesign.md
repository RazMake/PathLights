So each light will receive DC power through the burried cables. So the final board will have two tabs where to connect +12V (DC) and GND (comming from the house, from a 450W power adapter).  
I wanted to keep the power adapter in the house to protect it from the elements and make it easy to replace should it fail at some point.
